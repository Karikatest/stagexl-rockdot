## Rockdot Dart.

Port of Rockdot Actionscript Framework to Dart.

### Rockdot brings together the goodness of 
* Spring IoC container (ObjectFactory, ObjectFactory and Object Postprocessing, Interface Injection)
* Dart Commons Async library (FrontController and Commands/Operations, also sequences)
* Dart Commons EventBus (with some tweaks to Operations to make them as effective as Signals)
* Dart Commons Logging
* StageXL

### Rockdot features
* Plugin system making use of all of the above
* Mature screen (read: pages) lifecycle management
* Asset load management (porting in progress)
* Generic User Generated Content backend communication (porting in progress. reading does work.)
* i18n
* Focus on highly interactive rich media applications
* LOTS of examples (porting in progress, coming soon)

Rockdot Dart is based on Rockdot Actionscript, which has been in continuous development for several years,
and was used in over 50 rich media projects by creative agency Jung von Matt, serving millions of users.
